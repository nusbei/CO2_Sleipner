Neural network-based CO$_2$ interpretation for 4D Sleipner seismic images

## Abstract
Time-lapse or 4D seismic survey is a crucial monitoring tool for CO$_2$ geological sequestration. Conventional time-lapse interpretation provides detailed characterization of CO$_2$ distribution in the storage unit. However, manual interpretation is labour-intensive and often inconsistent throughout the long monitoring history, due to the inevitable changes in seismic acquisition and processing technology and interpreterâ€™s subjectivity. We propose a neural network (NN)-based interpretation method that translates baseline and monitoring seismic images to the probability of CO$_2$ presence. We use a simplified 3D U-net, whose training, validation and testing are all based on the Sleipner CO$_2$ storage project. The limited labels for training are derived from the interpreted CO$_2$ plume outlines within the internal sandstone layers for 2010. Then we apply the trained NN on different time-lapse seismic datasets from 1999 to 2010. The results suggest that our NN-based CO$_2$ interpretation has the following advantages: (1) high interpretation efficiency by automatic end-to-end mapping; (2) robustness against the processing-induced mismatch between the baseline and time-lapse inputs, relaxing the baseline reprocessing demands when compared to newly acquired or reprocessed time-lapse datasets; and (3) inherent interpretation consistency throughout multiple vintage datasets. Testing results with synthesized time-lapse images unveil that the NN takes both amplitude difference and structural similarity into account for CO 2 interpretation. We also compare 2D and 3D U-Nets under the scenario of sparse 2D labels for training. The results suggest that the 3D U-Net provides more continuous interpretation at the cost of larger computational resources for training and application.
